Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software presented by Digital Ocean, Intel and DEV. Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!

### Step 1. Register to Hacktoberfest 2020
##### Link to register: https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/

### Step 2. Create a Copy of this Repository
In order to work on an open-source project, you will first need to make your own copy of the repository. To do this, you should fork the repository and then clone it so that you have a local working copy.

> **Fork :fork_and_knife: this repo. Click on the Fork button at the top right corner.**

With the repository forked, you’re ready to clone it so that you have a local working copy of the code base.

> **Clone the Repository**

To make your own local copy of the repository you would like to contribute to, let’s first open up a terminal window.

We’ll use the git clone command along with the URL that points to your fork of the repository.

* Open the Command Prompt
* Type this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/teach-AI-in-business
```

### Step 3: Contribute
Add new links in the README.md. Add images, files. Contribute in any way you feel like :)

### Step 4: Commiting and Pushing:
Once you have modified an existing file or added a new file to the project, you can add it to your local repository, which we can do with the git add command.

``` git add filename``` or ``` git add .``` 

You can type the command ```git add -A``` or alternatively ```git add -all``` for all new files to be staged.


**With our file staged, we’ll want to record the changes that we made to the repository with the ```git commit``` command.**
<p> The commit message is an important aspect of your code contribution; it helps the other contributors fully understand the change you have made, why you made it, and how significant it is.  </p>
 
 ```
 git commit -m "commit message"
 ```
  
 At this point you can use the ```git push``` command to push the changes to the current branch of your forked repository:
 ```
 git push 
 ```
 
### Step 5: Create Pull Request
At this point, you are ready to make a pull request to the original repository.

You should navigate to your **forked** repository, and press the “Compare & pull request” button on the page. 

GitHub will alert you that you are able to merge the two branches because there is no competing code. You should add in a **title**, a **comment**, and then press the **“Create pull request”** button.

### Step 6: CONGRATULATIONS :boom: :clap: :relaxed:
Great! Wait for your Pull Request to be merged.
